<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p  id="PAR1" class="jp">
in 1631, Shah Jahan, emperor during the Mughal empire's period of greatest prosperity, was grief-stricken when his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, a Persian princess, died during the birth of their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.
BornPrince Khurram, he was the son of Emperor Jahangir and his Hindu Rajput wife, Taj Bibi Bilqis Makani (13 May 1573 - 18 April 1619).
While young, Khurram was the favourite of his legendary grandfather, the third Mughal emperor Akbar.
</p>

<h2>Marriage</h2>
<p  id = "PAR2" class="jp">
the Taj Mahal was built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the center of Agra in exchange for the land.
An area of roughly three acres was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above riverbank.
In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb.
The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.
</p>

<h2>Contributions to architecture</h2>
<p  id = "PAR3" class="jp">
abdul Hamid Lahauri,the official history of Shah Jahan's reign, calls Taj Mahal rauza-i munawwara, which means the illumined or illustrious tomb.
Soon after the Taj Mahal's completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort.
Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife.
<br>
By the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen badly into disrepair. During the time of the Indian rebellion of 1857, the Taj Mahal was defaced by British soldiers and government officials, who chiselled out precious stones and lapis lazuli from its walls.
At the end of the 19th century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908. He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a Cairo mosque.
During this time the garden was remodelled with British-style lawns that are still in place today.
