<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="jp">
Gaius Julius CaesarJuly 100[4] â€“ 15 March 44 BC)[5] was a Roman general, statesman, Consul, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that was to dominate Roman politics for several years.

Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain.

When Caesar returned to Rome, the Senate granted him triumphs for his victories, ostensibly those over Gaul, Egypt, Pharnaces and Juba, rather than over his Roman opponents. Not everything went Caesar's way
